Pseudocode:

Ask user1 for the word
Maximum trails allowed is the length of the word * 2
Set result to ‘- - - - -‘ ( ‘-‘ same number of letters the word has)
loop till trails = 0
	Ask user2 to guess a letter
	Trails - 1
	If letter is included in the word
		check in which position/s
		reveal the letter in the same position/s in your result
	If letter not included 
		ask to try again
	If trails = 0
		end the program and print ‘game over’
	If all ‘-‘ converts to letters
		end the program and print ‘you won’
End loop
