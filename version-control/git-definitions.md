# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?

>**Version control** is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that we can recall specific versions later.

>There are many benefits of using a version control system and these are the main ones:

>* Collaboration
>* Storing Versions (Properly)
>* Restoring Previous Versions
>* Understanding What Happened
>* Backup

* What is a branch and why would you use one?

>A **branch** is a very useful tool can be used to diverge from the main line of development and continue to do work without messing with that main line.

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?

>A **commit** records changes we make to the repository.

>A **good commit message** has to summarize the changes made since last commit. It should be clear to find out why a particular change was made to the code or why a specific feature was added.

* What is a merge conflict?

>**Merge conflict** happened when two people changed the same lines in that same file, or if one person decided to delete it while the other person decided to modify it, Git simply cannot know what is correct. Git will then mark the file as having a conflict which we'll have to solve before we can continue our work.
